To recompile the kernel (perhaps you've made a change), you will need to do:
`BootHDIns`.  
It's easy (or at least I managed to on my first try) to mess this up. My steps to get this working were:  
`BootHDIns('C');` If your drive you're wanting to recompile the kernel on is different than C then you should likely change it.
