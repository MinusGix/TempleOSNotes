Various notes about writing TempleOS programs.  
--
Yes, some of the notes may be easily accessible inside of TempleOS, and might even be better at times (though I hope to make this better in at least some ways), this is searchable (outside of TempleOS) and more separated into proper categories.

If you can't find something in this (then i'd love a PR), then searching on github through https://github.com/minexew/TempleOS/ can help.
